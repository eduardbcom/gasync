# gasync
Set of utilities to handle concurrency tasks in Go. Inspired by 'yarn add async'.

## Motivation:
At some point of my journey with Go I realized that I want to hide all concurrency mess under pleasureable interface.
As long as I worked with JS for a while, the first idea was "I need something like the 'async' module. But in Go.".
